/*
 * I will document this function, but not the seven other functions
 * which decode the subsequent seven characters.  All of these functions
 * are essentially the same.  Multiple functions are necessary though
 * because each column of the password has a different set of encoding
 * patterns.
 *
 * The following section will attempt to explain the encoding scheme
 * for share passwords as stored in the Windows 95 registry.  I will
 * try to explain this as clearly as I can, however I really have no
 * background in encryption.  If you have any questions, please feel
 * free to send them to me at snakey@cs.umd.edu.
 *
 * First off, share passwords can be anywhere from one character to
 * eight.  "Read only" passwords and "Full access" passwords both use
 * the same encoding scheme, and so they both can be decoded by this
 * program.  There is a one-to-one relationship between the number of
 * characters in a password and the number of bytes in the encoded
 * password stored in the registry.  In fact, each encoded byte directly
 * corresponds to the letter in the corresponding column of the
 * unencoded password!  Ie: If I change a password "passwd" to "masswd",
 * only the first byte of the encrypted password will change.  Knowing
 * this, it is easy to see that all that needs to be done to decode
 * the password is to find a mapping from an encoded byte to a decoded
 * letter.  That's what this program does.  Unfortunately, things get
 * a little tricky because a letter in the first column of a password
 * is encoded using a slightly different algorithm than a letter
 * in the second column, and so on.
 *
 * There is another complexity which we do not really need to worry
 * about to a great extent, but we still need to be aware of.  Many
 * characters, when entered into a password, map to the same encoded
 * byte.  The best example of this is that both 'A' and 'a' are the
 * same as far as share passwords are concerned.  There are numerous
 * other examples of this, and this allows us to effectively limit the
 * range of characters we need to be able to decode.  The range of
 * ASCII values we will have to be able to decode turns out to be
 * from 32 to 159.  ASCII values higher than 159 tend to map to
 * encoded bytes which also represent more normal ASCII values.  So
 * if a user manages to create a password with high ASCII values
 * in it, that password will still be decoded by this program.
 * Although the decoded password won't look the same as the original,
 * it will work just as well.
 *
 * With all of the preliminaries out of the way, I can now move on
 * to describing the mapping from an encoded byte to it's corresponding
 * ASCII value.  I think the best way to describe this would be through
 * a picture of exactly how the characters from 32 to 63 are mapped
 * out in the code for the first letter in a password.  This table goes
 * beyond the 80 column format maintained in the rest of this document,
 * but it is really the best solution.  If the table below doesn't look
 * right, load this file up in a text editor that supports greater than
 * 80 columns.
 *
 *   Encoded byte (hex)    - 1F 1E 1D 1C 1B 1A 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 14 11 10 0F OE 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
 *   ASCII value (decimal) - 42 43 40 41 46 47 44 45 34 35 32 33 38 39 36 37 58 59 56 57 62 63 60 61 50 51 48 49 54 55 52 53
 *   Pair #                - |_6_| |_5_| |_8_| |_7_| |_2_| |_1_| |_4_| |_3_| |14_| |13_| |16_| |15_| |10_| |_9_| |12_| |11_|
 *   Quad #                - |__________2__________| |__________1__________| |__________3__________| |__________4__________|
 *   32 byte block #       - |______________________________________________1______________________________________________|
 *
 * The "Pair #", "Quad #", and "32 byte block #" rows each are there to
 * make the general ordering of the code more visible.  The first thing to
 * note is that the range of encoded byte values runs from 00 to 1f.  This
 * will not always be the case for the first set of 32 characters.  In
 * fact, the next set of 32 characters (ASCII 64 to ASCII 95) is not in
 * the range of 20 to 3f in encoded form.  I never concerned myself with
 * predicting exactly where each of the four 32 byte ranges are aligned
 * within the range of 0 to 256.  In my decoding scheme, I simply specify
 * the location of the first character in a 32 byte block (which I have
 * pre-determined via experimentation) and determine the locations of the
 * rest of the characters in the block relative to the inital value.  This
 * amounts to a total of four hand-decoded characters for the entire code.
 *
 * From a starting point which is given (in this case the fact that ASCII
 * 32 is encoded as 0x15), my decoding scheme follows a pattern that is
 * probably already apparent to you if you have examined the above table
 * closely.  First, if the encoded byte number is odd, it simple subtracts
 * one from this byte number to get the byte number of the encoded form of
 * the subsequent character.  This is much more simple than it sounds.
 * As an example, given that the code for ASCII 32 is 0x15, the program
 * knows that the code for ASCII 33 must be 0x14.  The tricky part is that
 * this is not always true for every code.  Recall that there is a different
 * coding scheme for each of the 8 columns in a password, and that the above
 * table only describes the coding scheme for the first column.  Other columns
 * reverse this relationship between the two ASCII values of a certain pair.
 *
 * Pairs are grouped into units of four, appearing in a predefined pattern.
 * In this case, the first pair (by first I mean the pair with the lowest
 * set of ASCII values) is put in the second slot of a quad (which contains
 * four pairs).  The second pair is put in the first slot, the third is put
 * in the fourth quad, and the fourth is put in the third quad.  This changes
 * depending on the specific code used (of the 8 possible).
 *
 * Quads also fill a block in the same manner, however the ordering is NOT
 * necessarily the same as the way pairs fit into quads!  As I described
 * above, there are four blocks, and they fit into the entire range of
 * 128 values just as pairs fit into quads and quads fit into blocks,
 * via a pattern determined by whoever invented this encoding scheme.  It
 * is important to realize that the range of 128 possible encoded
 * values can be anywhere within the range of 0 to 256.  Ie: One block can
 * be positioned from 0x00 to 0x1f, while another block in the same code
 * can be positioned from 0xa0 to 0xbf.
 *
 * I realize that the above description is a bit complex, and it doesn't
 * really cover much of _how_ my program decodes the the encoded values.
 * If you honestly can't understand a word I've said, just go back to
 * the table and really take a long look at it.  Print it out, put it
 * under your pillow when you go to sleep.  Sooner or later the order
 * of it all will dawn on you and you should be able to step through
 * my code and see how it derives its answer, at least for the
 * DecodeCharOne() routine.  Seven other tables (which I have rough
 * copies of here on notebook paper) were needed to come up with
 * the seven other decoders for the seven other character places.
